# Anime Score Scrapper
Scrapes anime scores from MyAnimeList, Anime Planet, and AniList using BeautifulSoup

## Purpose
This is just a personal project I did to not only brush up my Python skills, but to also learn how to web scrape using BeautifulSoup. I chose to do an anime score web scraper because I wanted to do a project based on something I enjoy.

## Details
Enter the anime you want to know the score of. The rogram will perform a search on Google for said anime on MyAnimeList, AnimePlanet and AniList, and scrape needed data. The program will return the title of the anime, score, total number of votes, and a link to its page for each site, all scaled to a score of 100 for easy comparisons.

## How To Run
You must need Python 3 and BeautifulSoup 4 installed in order to run this program.
Extract files to your computer and run **python3 animescorescraper.py** on terminal (remember to have it on the same directory)
(Note: This was tested using Ubuntu 18.04, unsure of how/if it runs on other OS's)
